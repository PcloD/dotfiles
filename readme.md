These are my dot files. There are many like them, but these are mine. They are my life. I must master them as I must master my life.  Without me my dotfiles are useless.  Without my dotfiles, I am useless.

OK, enough of that. Obviously, this setup is specific to me and my personal work habits. You're not going to copy them and use them as-is. But hopefully there is a neat trick or two that you can pick up by looking them over.

They are in a constant state of change. I doubt I go 2-3 days without tweaking some aspect of them. I add some new trick or plugin I see on line. Stuff I don't use gets deleted. Some of them need more work than others. Creative criticism and suggestions are welcome.
